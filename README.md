Identify, track, and care for common houseplants. Plus, see their horoscope for the day, because why not?

Using an Image Classifier ML model generated from 2,000+ photos of houseplants, the user can manually choose the species of houseplant or identify it from their Camera Roll. They can also give it a nickname, description, and birthday.

On the more practical side, users can also learn about their plants' needs for watering, sunlight, growing medium and humidity.
